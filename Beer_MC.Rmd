#managing missing values - ABV values are missing for 62 of the 2,405 rows and IBU values are missing for 1,005 of 2,410 rows. The ABV values look like there are missing completely at random. While I can't find any evidence of "missing at random" or "not missing at random" for IBU values, my gut says I am not looking at all the angles. I made a called to calculate the mean and populate the missing data with mean values. This has been done for both ABV and IBU. All the below questions are answered based on this dataset.

The range of ABV values extends from 2.7% to 12.5%, with 5% as the first quartile and 6.8% as the third quartile. The distribution of ABV values appears to be right-skewed, indicating that the majority of beers have lower alcohol content. However, there are some outliers with exceptionally high ABV values, which may represent specialty beers."
